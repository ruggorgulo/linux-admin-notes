# How to install latest git version on Debian

## Debian Wheezy

You can still use the Git PPA for Ubuntu Precise by telling apt to build from the latest source it finds there. The distributions are similar enough that this should work just fine.

I used it with success on Raspbian (which is based on wheezy) to get packages for armhf, but it should work for any architecture.

First add the GPG key for the PPA:
```
apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E1DF1F24
```

Add the URL for the source packages to apt:
```
cat > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/git.list << EOF
deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/git-core/ppa/ubuntu precise main
EOF
```

Update apt:
```
apt-get update
```

Install build dependencies:
```
apt-get build-dep git
```

Download and build git from source. You may want to do this is a temporary directory, as the build process creates a bit of cruft:
```
apt-get -b source git
```

Install the package you just built and clean up (git-core is no longer needed):
```
dpkg -i git_*.deb git-man_*.deb
dpkg -P git-core
```


## Do backporting yourself.

Basically you go like this (a link to the .dsc file is taken from the package's page in unstable):

```
apt-get install devscripts
mkdir ~/devel && cd $_
dget http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/g/git/git_2.1.4-2.1.dsc
dpkg-source -x git_2.1.4-2.1.dsc
cd git
```

Check if you have all the build dependencies satisfied by running:
```
dpkg-checkbuilddeps
```

And install everything that tool says is presently missing. Sometimes a package might refer to a version of something too fresh to be available in the distro you're backporting to; in this case it's okay to try to cheat and fix the version of such a package in the debian/control file.

Now fix up the version of the packages about to be built. The best way to achieve this is to have a tool do the right thing:
```
$ dch --bpo
```

It will add an entry to the debian/changelog file and open your text editor of choice to oversee it. Just close the editor â€” the version for the packages to be built is taken from the top entry in this file.

Now let's actually attempt to build:
```
$ dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us -b
```

If you're lucky, at this point you'll have a bunch of shiny new Git .deb packages in .., which you can just install using `dpkg -i <packagename>` ....

(Run `debuild clean` to get rid of the built crud or just remove the git directory completely. You might also want to remove whatever you installed after running `dpkg-checkbuilddep`.)
