# ufw supports connection rate limiting, which is useful for protecting
# against brute-force login attacks. ufw will deny connections if an IP
# address has attempted to initiate 6 or more connections in the last
# 30 seconds. See  http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/187
# for details. Typical usage is:

- name: UFW - limit ssh
  become: yes
  ufw:
    rule: limit
    port: ssh
    proto: tcp


- name: UFW - default deny incomming
  become: yes
  ufw:
    direction: incomming
    policy: deny
